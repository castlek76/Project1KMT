This website is a Travel Agent Portfolio page highlighting what I can book for clients, 
introducing myself to them and giving them a way to connect with me through the contact form.

This site will be used for clients to gain an understanding of what I can do for them as a Travel Agent, 
what I can book for them, how that benefits them, how to contact me and allow them to get to know the person they are working with. 
The website uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Some ideas for future improvement include adding more to the home page about why you should book with a travel agent and what 
benefits we provide, highlight everything I can do for them for Disney and Universal trips since they are very hands on planning destinations, 
and a page where traveled clients can leave reviews and send referrals to potential clients.
